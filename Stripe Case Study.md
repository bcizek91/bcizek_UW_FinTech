![alt text](https://www.business.com/images/rz/5cd4675a9c658aa9678b458e/Stripe.png)
## Overview and Origin
***
**Name of company:**

Stripe, Inc.

**When was the company incorporated?**

Founded in 2010

**Who are the founders of the company?**

Irish entrepreneur brothers, John and Patrick Collison

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**

During the late 2000s, as brothers John and Patrick Collison were attending university, these young Irish entrepreneurial engineers started working on several side projects, debating why it was so difficult for companies to accept payments on the internet. Armed with their engineering backgrounds and the desire to make online payments “simple”, John and Patrick partnered with a Y Combinator, 280 North, to fund their prototype and begin the journey that would become a global payments powerhouse.

Early on, these brothers didn’t know how big this market was, if they could actually deliver on the “simple” user experience that they wanted, or how to address issues like fraud or non-US payments, but they endeavored on anyway to solve problems similar to PayPal, but in a simpler, user-friendly way.

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

Beginning in August of 2010, Stripe, a privately-held company, has gone through 14 rounds funding, 2 of which were Seed rounds from venture capitalists such as Peter Thiel, Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowtiz, 11 Series A-G+ rounds and another secondary market . To date, Stripe has raised over $1.64B is currently valued at $36B.

## Business Activities:

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

Stripe is a technology company which offers a cloud-based, platform and suite of applications that are solutioned to solve a wide variety of digital and financial complexity for its customers. These problems include, but are not limited to, outdated financial infrastructure, increase fraud & abuse, managing online marketplaces, processing transactions in foreign markets, managing connections to numerous applications, and lackluster checkout user experiences. Simply put, Stripe builds software to enable its customers to accept payments and manage their businesses online.

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

Stripe’s ambition is to be the world’s technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet, raising the 3% e-commerce bar, out of the world’s total GPD, which was ~$80T in 2019. McKinsey & Company estimate the global payments solutions market to be $1.9T in 2019, growing to $2.7 by 2023. Behind PayPal, Stripe is the 2nd largest payment e-commerce payment processer with roughly 20% share of the world’s e-commerce domains. 

Stripe’s customer segments include e-commerce & retail, B2B platforms, SaaS, B2C marketplaces and non-profits & fundraising companies. According to an IDC customer survey, the average Stripe customer has 2,275 employees, 45,111 online payment transactions per year, and $5.5M transaction volume per year. The simplicity and extensiveness of Stripe’s platform has enabled the large enterprise customers like Salesforce.com, Uber and Amazon, all the way to the mom-and-pops and non-profits. 

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
What sets Stripe apart from its competitors is its developer-first approach. Historically, the CFO was responsible for selecting a company’s payments provider and processing software. This buyer of payment solutions has changed as companies digitally transform. Stripe’s focus on developers created a way for businesses to accept payments with only a few lines of code through an extensive portfolio of open and transparent APIs. This saved customers from having to go through difficult vendor onboardings and troubleshooting complex integrations from multiple vendors and payment options

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**

## Landscape:

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

Stripe primarily competes in the payments/billing segment of the financial industry, but also implicitly involved with enterprise solutions and open banking as they participate in and process foreign currencies.

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**

Over the past 5-10 years there has been a monumental shift as companies transform their business models and strategic to adapt to the accelerating growth of the digital economy. Traditional companies are being disrupted by “digital-native” companies like Facebook, Uber, Netflix, and Stripe, as consumers become accustomed the intuitive, mobile-first, and intelligent experiences. Companies new and old are moving their business model to subscription-first commercialization and apps and infrastructure to the cloud in SaaS deployments. 
Stripe took full advantage of their disruptive technological trends to not only compete with traditional tech players like PayPal, but traditional payment and banking networks as well, such as FirstData. All of these players have shifted transactions from cash to plastic via credit and debit card availability. FinTech players such as Square, Venmo, ApplePay, etc. are continuing this digitization trend by enabling peer-to-peer transactions via apps or smart device taps.

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**

Companies in the billing & payments segment are, but not limited to:

- ApplePay, GooglePay, Microsoft Pay, AliPay, AmazonPay
- Venmo (Braintree)
- Square
- Stripe
- PayPal
- FirstData
- Gravity Payments

Summary

Of those sampled by Forrester, Stripe customers experienced an ROI of 364% due to an average of $6.1M in experienced benefits and $1.3M costs, adding up to a net present value of $4.8M. The payback period is estimated to be less than 3months which is impressive for a platform/infrastructure company, as it iss known for high implementation costs.  

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

The payment solutions industry tracks a wide variety of metrics related to transactions. The primary metrics that companies use in this domain to measure success are:

Number of customer accounts
 - Stripe: 2M
 - PayPal: 286M
 - Square: 24M
 - FirstData: 10M
 - AmazonPay: 33M
 - ApplePay: 441M 
 - GooglePay: 100M

Total payment volume
 - Stripe: $350B
 - PayPal: $221B
 - Square: $106B
 - FirstData: $2.3T
 - AmazonPay: Not listed
 - ApplePay: $99B 
 - GooglePay: $110B

Number of website domains
 - Stripe: 156K (20%)
 - PayPal: 427K (55%)
 - Square: 15K (2%)
 - FirstData: Not listed
 - AmazonPay: 30K (4%)
 - ApplePay: Not listed 
 - GooglePay: 5K (<1%)

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

Given that Stripe has a small customer set (2M) compared to its competitors, they are generating a high ratio of volume per customer (175K per customer vs. Paypal’s $772). Coupled with 20% share of the e-commerce website domain market, Stripe is proving to be the trusted payment’s solution for some of the world’s largest online companies (Salesforce, Uber, Shopify). Traditional payments providers like First Data and PayPal will continue to lead the market share of customers as they have been around for much longer, but Stripe is proving to be the preferred provider for e-commerce. It will be interesting to see how quickly these dynamics change as large enterprises to small mom-and-pop businesses transform to become digital-native.

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!) Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

As noted by Stripe, only 3% of the world’s GDP happens online as most of commerce still transacts by hand or through traditional payment networks like FirstData. To raise the bar on this market share and to takeout its competition from PayPal, Square and the big cloud providers, Stripe should partner with and create a platform for getting local/regional traditional payment processors online. Midmarket and small businesses predominately process their payments through hardware provided by these local/regional players. Creating a method of transitioning these traditional businesses from brick-and-motor to a digital-native company at low cost to the owner would unlock a huge amount of volume. This would not only help the local businesses, but it would also help to digitally transform these payment processor partners as well. Until all businesses accept all payment options, there is a huge opportunity in helping to provide the product, platform, and services to bring traditional payment online.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

Stripe would have to build a platform that combines their existing software platform with a variety of hardware systems provided by various payment processors. This “hybrid” approach in transacting payments would allow customers to use whichever method they prefer at a local business and not put the extra cost back on the business owner. ApplePay, GooglePay are starting to do this through partnering with processors, but the relationship likely stops at the transaction. Stripe has the opportunity to not only be the software/hardware platform by which payments are transacted, but to be partner in helping small and medium size businesses to manage their financials by helping to provide technologies and services that currently only the big e-commerce players can afford, like machine learning, fraud & abuse protection and financial automation.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

Stripe’s developer-first approach has significantly lowered the cost of entry into e-commerce for businesses of all sizes. In small and medium size businesses, margins are everything, where an unplanned cost can make or break staying in business. By lowering the total cost of technologies and services like machine learning, payment networking and integrations, fraud & abuse protection, can help to provide a “digital safety net” for local businesses. If Stripe wants to world’s GDP to transact “online”, these technologies will need become more affordable, simple and intuitive for all segments of the market, especially small and medium sized businesses that don’t have huge developer workforces or extra cash on hand to develop solutions. Making these hybrid deployments available via local payment networks should significantly lower the cost of these services and bring payments fully “online”.
